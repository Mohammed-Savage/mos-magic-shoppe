# Mo's Magic Shoppe

This is just a very simple and small app I created using Create React App to mock up a Magic the Gathering Card shop.

After navigating into the foloder containing my db.json (public) run json-server --watch db.json. Then, in another Terminal window please navigate to the parent folder (mos-magic-shoppe) then run npm install. After that succeeds, please run npm start and enjoy! # mos-magic-shoppe
